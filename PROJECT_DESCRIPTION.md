### Your Visionary Friend That Sees Threats Before You Do

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Phishing is one of the most dangerous and widespread cyber threats today.  
A single malicious link can compromise:

- Bank accounts
- Email accounts
- University portals
- Enterprise systems

Most users cannot visually distinguish between legitimate and fake links, and many existing systems rely only on blacklists, which fail against **new and unknown attacks**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: Nemitra AI

**Nemitra AI** is an AI-powered phishing detection and prevention platform that analyzes suspicious URLs **before users interact with them**.

Nemitra AI:
- Acts as a **digital friend** for users
- Sees threats before users do
